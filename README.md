# Beginning .NET Service Development Class

## Course Materials

Materials for deeper exploration are in the [Course](./course/README.md) folder.

## Labs and Demos

There are folders named `labs` and `demos` that will extend some of the material we do in class.

## Containers Deep-Dive

To extend and review the material in the class, you are invited to sign up for the *absolutely free, no strings attached* online course I created at (https://hypertheory.podia.com/containers-for-developers).
